# Short about me 
st.write("""
    Hi, my name is Ishan Jandaur and I am currently a product design engineer at Lyten. In this role, I design cylindrical battery cells using Li-S chemistry.
         
    I was born and raised in San Jose, CA and have a bachelor's degree from California Polytechnic State University - San Luis Obispo.
    Although my degree is in mechanical engineering, my work experience and interests have varied quite a bit. I have worked in batteries, on medical devices, and even in high volume contract manufacturing environments.
         
    Feel free to reach out to me on Linkedin or by email if you want to chat!
